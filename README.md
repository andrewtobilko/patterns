There are three kinds of software design patterns 
(well-known as GOF patterns that have become a de facto standard in the programmers' world): 
creational, structural and behavioral patterns. Concurrency patterns won't be considered, because they aren't a part of GoF.
  
You could find out about all of them here, in this repository.

* Creational

    * [Singleton](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/github/tobilko/creational/singleton/
                  "Singleton")
                  - to allow a class to create one instance
    * [Simple Factory](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/github/tobilko/creational/simplefactory/
                       "Simple Factory") *

    * [Factory Method](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/github/tobilko/creational/factorymethod/ 
                       "Factory Method")
                       - to allow a class to defer instantiation to its subclasses

    * [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/github/tobilko/creational/abstractfactory/
                         "Abstract Factory")
                         - to create a families of related objects without having to depend on their concrete classes

* Behavioral

    * [Template method](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/github/tobilko/behavioral/templatemethod/
                        "Template method")

*The patterns marked by * don't relate to GoF patterns. They are simply a part of good practice of software development.*
