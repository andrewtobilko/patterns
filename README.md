There are three kinds of software design patterns (well-known as GoF patterns).

You could find out about all of them here, in this repository.

* Creational
    * [Singleton](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/tobilko/singleton/ "Singleton")
    * [Simple Factory](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/tobilko/simplefactory/ "Simple Factory") *

     * [Factory Method](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/tobilko/factorymethod/ "Factory Method")

     * [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/tobilko/abstractfactory/ "Abstract Factory")

* Structural
    * [Adapter](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/tobilko/adapter/ "Adapter")
    * [Facade](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/tobilko/facade/ "Facade")
    * [Decorator](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/tobilko/decorator/ "Decorator")
* Behavioral
    * [Template method](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/tobilko/templatemethod/ "Template method")

    * [Iterator](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/tobilko/iterator/ "Iterator")
    * [Command](https://github.com/andrewtobilko/patterns/tree/master/src/com/tobilko/command/ "Command")


*The patterns marked by * don't relate to GoF patterns. They are simply a part of good practice of software development.*
